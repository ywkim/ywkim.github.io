In this post, we will explore how GPT-Commit works in real-world scenarios by looking at examples from the <a href=\"https://github.com/angular/angular\">Angular project</a>. We will also discuss the benefits of using GPT-Commit. If you're new to GPT-Commit, check out our <a href=\"https://ywkim.github.io/automating-commit-messages-with-gpt-commit/\">previous post</a> for an introduction and usage guide.</p>\n<h2>GPT-Commit in Action: Real-world Examples</h2>\n<p>In this section, we'll take a look at some real-world examples of commit messages generated by GPT-Commit. These examples are taken from the <a href=\"https://github.com/angular/angular\">Angular project</a> and compared with the original commit messages written by developers.</p>\n<h3>GPT-Commit for Documentation Updates</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Original Commit</strong>: \"docs: add mention of paramsInheritanceStrategy in the router doc\" (<a href=\"https://github.com/angular/angular/commit/0623158505\">0623158505</a>)</li>\n<li><strong>GPT-Commit</strong>: \"docs(router): add information about using parent component's route info\"</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In this example, GPT-Commit accurately identifies that the commit is related to documentation updates. It also provides more specific information about the update in the commit message.</p>\n<h3>GPT-Commit for Bug Fixes</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Original Commit</strong>: \"fix(upgrade): Use <code class=\"language-text\">takeUntil</code> on leaky subscription.\" (<a href=\"https://github.com/angular/angular/commit/253d756464\">253d756464</a>)</li>\n<li><strong>GPT-Commit</strong>: \" fix: fix missing import in downgrade_component_adapter.ts\"</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Here, GPT-Commit identifies a bug fix, specifically a missing import in a TypeScript file. However, the developer's commit message provides a more precise explanation of the change by mentioning the usage of <code class=\"language-text\">takeUntil</code> on a leaky subscription. The developer's message captures the intent of the fix more accurately than GPT-Commit.</p>\n<h3>GPT-Commit for Feature Addition</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Original Commit</strong>: \"refactor(compiler): introduce block parsing in lexer\" (<a href=\"https://github.com/angular/angular/commit/29aaded0c3\">29aaded0c3</a>)</li>\n<li><strong>GPT-Commit</strong>: \"feat(ml_parser): add parsing support for block groups and blocks\"</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In this example, GPT-Commit correctly identifies the change as a feature addition related to parsing support. Although the developer labeled it as a refactor, the essence of the change is captured accurately by GPT-Commit.</p>\n<h3>GPT-Commit for Dependency Update</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Original Commit</strong>: \"build: update eslint dependencies to v5.61.0\" (<a href=\"https://github.com/angular/angular/commit/6538e67e30\">6538e67e30</a>)</li>\n<li><strong>GPT-Commit</strong>: \"build(aio): Update @typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin and @typescript-eslint/parser to version 5.61.0\"</li>\n</ul>\n<p>GPT-Commit correctly identifies a dependency update and specifies the packages and version number. The developer's message is more concise but less specific. Both messages accurately reflect the nature of the change.</p>\n<h3>GPT-Commit for GitHub Action Update</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Original Commit</strong>: \"build: update github/codeql-action action to v2.20.3\" (<a href=\"https://github.com/angular/angular/commit/6cac41f039\">6cac41f039</a>)</li>\n<li><strong>GPT-Commit</strong>: \"ci(.github/workflows): update codeql-action version for Upload to code-scanning\"</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In this example, GPT-Commit accurately recognizes the commit as a CI configuration update and provides a clear description of the update in the commit message.</p>\n<h2>Benefits of Using GPT-Commit</h2>\n<p>GPT-Commit offers several benefits to developers:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Time-saving</strong>: GPT-Commit automates the task of writing commit messages, saving developers' time.</li>\n<li><strong>Consistency</strong>: GPT-Commit generates commit messages in a consistent format, making the commit history easier to read and understand.</li>\n<li><strong>Focus on coding</strong>: With GPT-Commit taking care of commit messages, developers can focus more on coding.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>We Want Your Feedback!</h2>\n<p>We're always looking to improve GPT-Commit and we'd love to hear your thoughts. If you've used GPT-Commit, please share your experiences. If you haven't, we encourage you to give it a try and let us know what you think. You can provide feedback by creating an issue in our <a href=\"https://github.com/ywkim/gpt-commit\">GitHub repository</a>.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>GPT-Commit is a powerful tool that can save developers' time and increase efficiency by automating the task of writing commit messages. Through real-world examples from the Angular project, we've seen how GPT-Commit generates commit messages across different types of commits. We encourage you to try GPT-Commit and experience its benefits for yourself.
