Welcome to our follow-up post on GPT-Commit, an AI-powered tool that generates commit messages to save developers' time and increase efficiency. In this post, we will explore how GPT-Commit works in real-world scenarios by looking at examples from the [Angular project](https://github.com/angular/angular). We will also discuss the benefits of using GPT-Commit. If you're new to GPT-Commit, check out our [previous post](https://ywkim.github.io/automating-commit-messages-with-gpt-commit/) for an introduction and usage guide.

## GPT-Commit in Action: Real-world Examples

In this section, we'll take a look at some real-world examples of commit messages generated by GPT-Commit. These examples are taken from the [Angular project](https://github.com/angular/angular) and compared with the original commit messages written by developers.

### GPT-Commit for Documentation Updates

- **Original Commit**: "docs: add mention of paramsInheritanceStrategy in the router doc" ([0623158505](https://github.com/angular/angular/commit/0623158505))
- **GPT-Commit**: "docs(router): add information about using parent component's route info"

In this example, GPT-Commit accurately identifies that the commit is related to documentation updates. It also provides more specific information about the update in the commit message.

### GPT-Commit for Bug Fixes

- **Original Commit**: "fix(upgrade): Use `takeUntil` on leaky subscription." ([253d756464](https://github.com/angular/angular/commit/253d756464))
- **GPT-Commit**: " fix: fix missing import in downgrade_component_adapter.ts"

Here, GPT-Commit identifies a bug fix, specifically a missing import in a TypeScript file. However, the developer's commit message provides a more precise explanation of the change by mentioning the usage of `takeUntil` on a leaky subscription. The developer's message captures the intent of the fix more accurately than GPT-Commit.

### GPT-Commit for Feature Addition

- **Original Commit**: "refactor(compiler): introduce block parsing in lexer" ([29aaded0c3](https://github.com/angular/angular/commit/29aaded0c3))
- **GPT-Commit**: "feat(ml_parser): add parsing support for block groups and blocks"

In this example, GPT-Commit correctly identifies the change as a feature addition related to parsing support. Although the developer labeled it as a refactor, the essence of the change is captured accurately by GPT-Commit.

### GPT-Commit for Dependency Update

- **Original Commit**: "build: update eslint dependencies to v5.61.0" ([6538e67e30](https://github.com/angular/angular/commit/6538e67e30))
- **GPT-Commit**: "build(aio): Update @typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin and @typescript-eslint/parser to version 5.61.0"

GPT-Commit correctly identifies a dependency update and specifies the packages and version number. The developer's message is more concise but less specific. Both messages accurately reflect the nature of the change.

### GPT-Commit for GitHub Action Update

- **Original Commit**: "build: update github/codeql-action action to v2.20.3" ([6cac41f039](https://github.com/angular/angular/commit/6cac41f039))
- **GPT-Commit**: "ci(.github/workflows): update codeql-action version for Upload to code-scanning"

In this example, GPT-Commit accurately recognizes the commit as a CI configuration update and provides a clear description of the update in the commit message.

## Benefits of Using GPT-Commit

GPT-Commit offers several benefits to developers:

- **Time-saving**: GPT-Commit automates the task of writing commit messages, saving developers' time.
- **Consistency**: GPT-Commit generates commit messages in a consistent format, making the commit history easier to read and understand.
- **Focus on coding**: With GPT-Commit taking care of commit messages, developers can focus more on coding.
